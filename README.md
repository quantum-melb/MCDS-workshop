# Quantum Computing for Data Science Workshop

**Are you interested in quantum computing and what it might mean for data science but donâ€™t know where to start?**

**Welcome to the MCDS Quantum Computing Workshop and learn the basics of quantum computing and how a quantum computer operates.**

Quantum computers represent the next evolutionary step for information processing. For some specific problems quantum computers outperform their conventional counterparts. The first quantum algorithms have already been demonstrated which outperform any classical algorithm. Although quantum computers are still bleeding-edge technology, being relatively small and noisy, they are developing fast and show tremendous potential for the future.

You will get to know some of the fundamental quantum algorithms and see these algorithms, such as the quantum computing equivalent of SVM, operating. We aim to give you the skills to understand these algorithms and a hands-on experience implementing them using real quantum computers over the cloud.

*No background in physics is required, but mathematical skills of linear algebra and complex numbers would be beneficial.*
